keygem

Unwise generator for random usernames and passwords.

Generates random strings for usernames and passwords.
Stores them so you don't have to remember them.
Maps them to AutoKeys so you don't have to type them.

Good:
Random, non-menmonic strings are hard to crack when the website you trusted has a security breach.
Different username/passwords for everything, so even if one is compromized, the others remain secure.

Bad:
Your usernames/passwords are all stored on one database making one, weak point of compromise.
	(but that point is under YOUR control).
You don't remember your login info, so if you lose your database, you can't log in.

Use ot your own risk.
keygem is not appropriate for use by anyone.
I don't trust you to keep your credentials safe, and you shouldn't either.
