keygem

Generator for random usernames and passwords.

Generates random strings for usernames and passwords.
Stores them so you don't have to remember them.
Maps them to AutoKeys so you don't have to type them.

Good:
Random, non-menmonic strings are hard to crack when the website you trusted has a security breach.
Different username/passwords for everything, so even if one is compromized, the others remain secure.

Bad:
Your usernames/passwords are all stored on one database making one, weak point of compromise.
	(but that point is under YOUR control).
You don't remember your login info, so if you lose your database, you can't log in.

Use ot your own risk.
keygem is not appropriate for use by anyone.
I don't trust you to keep your credentials safe, and you shouldn't either.

Requirements:
Python
AutoKey
SQLite

Design plan:

first run
Modifies Autokey config for ^F1-3 hotkeys.
Restarts Autokey

main
options for making and recalling user/pw combos.
saves entry in DB
option to back up db
option to load hotkeys
options for various stdout printing of values


pseudo:

start
Detect dependencies:
	autokey has ~/$USER/.config/autokey directory
	sqlite
	Fatal error if prerequisite software not present.
If present:
	Detect if autokey has hotkeys set (detect ctrl F1-3)
	if yes:
		Detect if scripts match correctly
		Script has ID comment headder to check for
		if no:
			Other autokey has control over hotkey. Warn and set flag that the keys will be unavailable.
		if yes,
			No changes needed
	if no:
		autokey scripts for keygem blueprint in json file
		copy file contents into correct place in autokey config file
	Detect if database exists
	if no:
		run sqlite command that creates database and empty table
		set first run flag
	if yes:
		skip
Prompt for password:
	This password will be used to encrypt/decrypt every entry in the db.
	So encrypt before saving hash in each field
	Decrypt after retreiving each hash.

	Is this first run? 
	Yes: set password
		Two prompts, values must match.
		no match:
			fail
		if match:
			login table created
			password stored as bcrypt hash
	No:
		One prompt
		decrypt vs saved password
		no match:
			fail
		match:
			password is used as salt for 2-way encryption on data saved in the keyring table
	
Initialization is complete at this point.

Get options:

Action options:
create
	Requires -a/--app option
	Check for modifier options
	also adds current date field
recall
	requires -a/--app
	filter response with -u for user only, -p for password only, both or none for neither
		recall and edit cycles through the app field of the db.
		using the provided app name, attempts to decrypt each value until a match
		if no match, assumed value is not saved
		if match, 
			first check date field and compare to today
			if today > 90 days, and no -q option, print reminder to change password
edit
	requires -a/--app
	optional -p for overriding random
	edits the password already stored
backup <path>
	saves a duplicate of the db to the provided path
	no options
changepass
	for changing the main password
	prompts for existing password
	prompts twice for matching new password
	if all good, saves new hash

Argument options:
-a --app=<string>
	The index id for the data.
	Cannot be duplicate, used to look up user name and password.
	Cannot be null.
	value is encrypted before storing with bcrypt
-u --user=<string>
	Instead of generating a random username, use the one provided.
	Cannot be null.
-p --pw=<string>
	Instead of generating a random password, use the one provided.
	Cannot be null
-k --autokey
	Load the values into the autokey scripts
	Puts the values in files in .config
	Scripts load values from files
	ctrl F1 user name
	ctrl F2 password
	ctrl F3 deletes the files
-o --stdout
	prints the values to stdout, see stdout modifiers

Modifier options:
Generator modifiers:
Where <n> = "p" or "u", Indicating that this modifier applies to either the password or user name generated
-n --no-num=<n>
	Omit numbers from the password
-s --no-special=<n>
	Omit special characters from the password
-l --lower-case=<n>
	Use only lower case letters
-U --upper-case=<n>
	Use only upper case letters
-X --no-letters=<n>
	Omit letters from the password
-n --length-pw=<l>
	Length of the password
-L --length-usr=<l>
	Length of the username

Output modifiers:

default output:
saved value only

-f --format
format as:
	USER=<username>
	PW=<password>

files:

cf1
cf2
template.json
keygem
init-keygem.py
main-keygem.py
crypt.php
ring.kg

NEXT TO DO:

- template scripts (edit from autokey) need a more dynamic way of determining
  the path to the cf files. The cf files appear in the keygem directory, but
  that directory could be anywhere. Since the calling program is autokey, the
  path to self will not work. Perhaps place the cf files in .config in home..

- initilaize the SQLlite database if not present

Final consideration and justification for my efforts:

The concept of a securty scheme involving both logical and physical components.
On your bank's website, there is no physical component. Your access to your
account online is purely logical. Your password, username, et al, can be
guessed.

Keep your keygem file on a USB stick. This is your physical. Allow keygem to
generate impossible to remember, long, random strings for your username and password
to your bank account.

You now need this stick to access your account (physical).
You also need to know your password to keygem to use the stick (logical).

Even if your password is conditioned from you, it is useless without the stick.
Even if the stick is stolen from you, it is useless without the password.

The code of keygem is open for your personal security audit. You know what is done with
your information, you know there is no back door.
